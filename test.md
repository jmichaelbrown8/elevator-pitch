### Quantifiers Though labeled rather unattractively (lazy, greedy) quantifiers are anything but! 
A quick way to match something any number of times. The most common are generic \*, the lazy '?' or the greedy repeater '+' <br> 

Examples:

```JS // * will repeat the previous item or group zero or more times. .* matches f in def // ^ matches the start of the string ^. matches d in def ```
