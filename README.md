"Like kickstarter, but for open source projects"

Elevator Pitch is a site to organize group projects based on ideas, rather than individuals. It allows users to create "Spaces" within which you can pitch an idea. Other users can browse those ideas and sign up as interested in contributing, or add comments to ask questions to the idea pitcher.

This site will be especially useful for organizing bootcamp group projects, or unconference topics (future development could include a schedule generator based on the network of interested individuals).
